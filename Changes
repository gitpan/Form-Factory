    * Make sure get_all_features() in the meta class does not clobber feature

    * The render_control() and consume_control() methods now return the control
      object rendered or consumed.
    * The Button control is now a boolean value rather than a preset value to
      make it much more useful
    * The CLI interface does not consume arguments from boolean values anymore,
      it just flips them on or off based on the fact they are present or not
    * Added unit tests for render_control() and consume_control()
