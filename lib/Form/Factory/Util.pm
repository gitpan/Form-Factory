=head1 NAME

Form::Factory::Util - Utility subroutines that don't belong anywhere else

=head1 VERSION

version 0.006

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Utility subroutines that don't belong anywhere else.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 class_name_from_name

  my $class_name = class_name_from_name($prefix, $name);

Used to build capitalized Form Factory class names from all lowercase names. 

This isn't something that would go into a general string library since it understands some internals of Form Factory to do this work.

sub class_name_from_name($$) {
    my ($prefix, $name) = @_;

    # Remove anything like #Foo, which is used to differentiate between features
    # added by different classes in get_all_features()
    $name =~ s/\#(.*)$//;

    # Turn a foo_bar_baz name into FooBarBaz
    $name =~ s/(?:[^A-Za-z]+|^)([A-Za-z])/\U$1/g;

    return join('::', 'Form::Factory', $prefix, ucfirst $name);
