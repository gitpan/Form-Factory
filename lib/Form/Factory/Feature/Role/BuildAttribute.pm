  use Moose;

  with qw(
      Form::Factory::Feature
      Form::Factory::Feature::Role::BuildAttribute
      Form::Factory::Feature::Role::Control
  );

  sub build_attribute {
      my ($class, $options, $meta, $name, $attr) = @_;

  sub register_implementation { 'MyApp::Feature::FillFromRecord' }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Control features that implement this role are given the opportunity to directly modify the action attribute just before it is added to the meta-class. 

This is done by implementing the C<build_attribute> class method. This method will be passed a hash representing the feature arguments for this feature (since the feature will not yet exist as an object). It will then be passed the meta-class object, the name of the attribute being added, and a normalized hash of attribute parameters.

You may use these arguments to manipulate the attribute before it is created, create additional attributes, etc.
